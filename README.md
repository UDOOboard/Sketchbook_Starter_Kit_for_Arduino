===========================

This repository contains the example sketches to use the Grove starter kit for UDOO boards.

Download this repo and move the folders in your Arduino Sketchbook folder.  

If you are using UDOObuntu (with UDOO NEO or UDOO QUAD/DUAL) you can move this repo inside the default user folder:

Now you can open the Arduino IDE and found all the example inside the `File -> Sketchbook` menu.
